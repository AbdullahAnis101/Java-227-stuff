#The following is a valid program for the CS227Comp architecture, with the
#following caveat: Our input routines are not sophisticated enough to handle
#the comments that appear in this code!  In order to run this program, you
#will need to remove all comments manually, or write input routines that can
#handle them.  Everything from a hash (#) to the end of the line where it
#appears is a comment.
+1006  #read (opcode 10) a value from the terminal into memory address 06
+1007  #read (10)  a value from the terminal into memory address 07
+3006  #load (30) the value at memory address 06 into the accumulator
+5007  #add (50) the value at memory 07 to the accumulator
+4008  #store (40) the accumulator at memory 08
+2008  #write (20) the value at 08
